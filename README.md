Definition of Technical Specs for Lab #5This   week’s   simulation   lab   demonstrates   the   principle   of   load   flow   analysis   for   a   power network.   Up   till   now   load   flow   has   been   applied   to   simple   two   port   systems.   In   this   coursework an interconnected three bus system is studied where each bus type is   considered.   This demonstrates how the known and unknown variables are typically   distributed around the   network.Using the   MATLAB Simulink software   build the   ideal   50   Hz   network as shown   in   Figure   5.1   with   the   personalised   set   of   data   in Table代 写Power Networks EEEE3002 Definition of Technical Specs for Lab #5Matlab
